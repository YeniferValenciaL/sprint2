          <td>Fried ice cream with cream and melted chocolate <br>
            Ingredients
            320 grams of vanilla ice cream
            200 grams of flour
            10 grams of yeast
            100 milliliters of chocolate syrup
            100 milliliters of whipping cream
            Mild olive oil</td>
          <td>Whip the cream, which must be very cold, until it is whipped. Place in a piping bag with a fluted nozzle and set aside in the refrigerator. br
            With an ice cream scoop, form balls of vanilla ice cream. Put them on a tray, cover with plastic wrap and leave them in the freezer for 1 hour. <br>
            Divide the flour into 2 parts and place each in a bowl. Add the yeast to one and pour water, stirring constantly, until you obtain a thick cream. <br>
            Remove the ice cream balls from the freezer and roll them, one at a time, first in the flour and then in the cream. <br>
            Pour plenty of oil in a deep frying pan or saucepan, put it on the heat and heat it until it starts to bubble. Fry the ice cream balls, in batches, for a few seconds, until golden brown. br
            Remove them with a slotted spoon and let them drain, just for a few moments, on a double sheet of kitchen paper. Divide the ice creams on plates and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce and a rosette of whipped cream.</td>
